## pdb_to_csv Function

Converts a PDB file to a CSV file, extracting relevant information.

### Parameters:
- `pdb_file` (str): Path to the input PDB file.
- `csv_file` (str): Path to the output CSV file.

### Usage:
```python
from Bio import PDB
import csv
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict

def pdb_to_csv(pdb_file, csv_file):

    Converts a PDB file to a CSV file, extracting relevant information.
    
    Args:
        pdb_file (str): Path to the input PDB file.
        csv_file (str): Path to the output CSV file.
    
    Returns:
        None
```
## process_loops Function
Processes loops in a given protein structure and calculates loop properties.

### Parameters
- `structure `(Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure): Input protein structure.
- `loops` (dict): Dictionary containing information about identified loops.

### Usage
```python
def process_loops(structure):

    Process loops in a given protein structure and calculate loop properties.
    
    Args:
        structure (Bio.PDB.Structure.Structure): Input protein structure.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing information about identified loops.
```
## print_loop_summary Function
Prints a summary of loop properties.

### Parameters:
- `loops` (dict): Dictionary containing information about identified loops.
### Usage:
```python
def print_loop_summary(loops):

    Print a summary of loop properties.
    
    Args:
        loops (dict): Dictionary containing information about identified loops.
    
    Returns:
        None
```
## print_loop_details Function
Prints detailed information about identified loops.

### Parameters:
`loops` (dict): Dictionary containing information about identified loops.
### Usage:
```python
def print_loop_details(loops):

    Print detailed information about identified loops.
    
    Args:
        loops (dict): Dictionary containing information about identified loops.
    
    Returns:
        None
```
## Main Section
Handles the execution of the script.
```python
pdb_file = '8tim.pdb'  # Replace with your PDB file path
    pdb_parser = PDB.PDBParser(QUIET=True)
    structure = pdb_parser.get_structure('structure', pdb_file)

    loops = process_loops(structure)

    # Print loop summary
    print_loop_summary(loops)

    # Print loop details
    print_loop_details(loops)
```
